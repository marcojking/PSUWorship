# Vocal Harmony Theory

This skill provides comprehensive music theory knowledge for vocal harmonies, from fundamental concepts to advanced arranging techniques.

## 1. Intervals: The Foundation of Harmony

### What is an Interval?
An interval is the distance between two pitches. Intervals are the building blocks of all harmony.

### Interval Classification by Size
| Interval | Semitones | Quality | Sound Character |
|----------|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Unison | 0 | Perfect | Identical |
| Minor 2nd | 1 | Dissonant | Very tense, clashing |
| Major 2nd | 2 | Dissonant | Mild tension |
| Minor 3rd | 3 | Consonant | Sad, soft |
| Major 3rd | 4 | Consonant | Bright, happy |
| Perfect 4th | 5 | Context-dependent | Open, ambiguous |
| Tritone | 6 | Dissonant | Unstable, tense |
| Perfect 5th | 7 | Perfect consonant | Open, hollow, powerful |
| Minor 6th | 8 | Consonant | Warm, bittersweet |
| Major 6th | 9 | Consonant | Warm, pleasant |
| Minor 7th | 10 | Dissonant | Jazz tension |
| Major 7th | 11 | Dissonant | Dreamy tension |
| Octave | 12 | Perfect | Reinforcement |

### Interval Frequency Ratios (Just Intonation)
- Unison: 1:1
- Octave: 2:1
- Perfect 5th: 3:2
- Perfect 4th: 4:3
- Major 3rd: 5:4
- Minor 3rd: 6:5
- Major 6th: 5:3

Simple ratios = more consonant. Complex ratios = more dissonant.

### Interval Inversions
When you invert an interval (flip the notes), you get its complement to an octave:
- 3rd inverts to 6th (and vice versa)
- 2nd inverts to 7th (and vice versa)
- 4th inverts to 5th (and vice versa)
- Major inverts to minor (and vice versa)

This is why 3rds and 6ths are related and both sound consonant.

---

## 2. Consonance and Dissonance

### Perfect Consonances
- Unison (1:1)
- Octave (2:1)
- Perfect 5th (3:2)

### Imperfect Consonances
- Major and minor 3rds
- Major and minor 6ths

These are the most commonly used intervals for vocal harmony because they blend well while maintaining interest.

### Dissonances
- Major and minor 2nds
- Major and minor 7ths
- Tritone (augmented 4th / diminished 5th)

### The Perfect 4th: A Special Case
- Consonant when the lower note is NOT the bass
- Dissonant when the lower note IS the bass (creates expectation of resolution)
- Context determines its treatment

### Using Dissonance Effectively
Dissonance creates tension; consonance provides release. Music is a constant interplay between the two:
1. Approach dissonances by step when possible
2. Resolve dissonances by step (usually downward)
3. Place dissonances on weak beats (or use as suspensions on strong beats)
4. Short dissonances are easier to accept than long ones

---

## 3. Contrapuntal Motion Types

When two voices move, they can relate in four ways:

### Parallel Motion
Both voices move in the same direction by the same interval.
- **Allowed**: Parallel 3rds, parallel 6ths
- **Forbidden in classical style**: Parallel 5ths, parallel octaves (sound hollow, lose voice independence)
- **Modern use**: Parallel motion is common and effective in pop/rock

### Similar Motion
Both voices move in the same direction but by different intervals.
- Less independent than contrary motion
- More independent than parallel motion
- Watch for "hidden" or "direct" 5ths/octaves

### Contrary Motion
Voices move in opposite directions.
- **Most independent** - preferred in counterpoint
- Creates strongest voice distinction
- Best for avoiding forbidden parallels

### Oblique Motion
One voice holds while the other moves.
- Creates pedal tone effects
- Useful for emphasizing one voice
- Common in drone-based harmony

**Preference Order in Counterpoint**: Contrary > Oblique > Similar > Parallel

---

## 4. Voice Leading Principles

### Core Principles
1. **Smooth motion**: Move each voice by step (whole or half step) when possible
2. **Common tones**: If a note exists in both chords, keep it in the same voice
3. **Minimal distance**: When moving, go to the nearest chord tone
4. **Contrary motion to bass**: Upper voices often move opposite to the bass

### Rules to Follow
1. **No parallel 5ths or octaves** between any two voices
2. **No hidden 5ths or octaves** (approaching a perfect interval by similar motion)
3. **Resolve tendency tones**:
   - Leading tone (7th scale degree) → Tonic
   - Chordal 7th → Down by step
4. **Avoid voice crossing** (alto going above soprano, etc.)
5. **Avoid voice overlap** (alto moving to a note higher than soprano's previous note)
6. **Keep voices within their ranges**

### Doubling Guidelines (for triads in 4-part harmony)
- **Double the root** (most common, most stable)
- **Double the 5th** (acceptable alternative)
- **Avoid doubling the 3rd** (defines chord quality; doubling weakens it)
- **NEVER double the leading tone** (creates resolution problems)

### Spacing Guidelines
- Soprano to alto: No more than an octave apart
- Alto to tenor: No more than an octave apart
- Tenor to bass: Can be more than an octave (bass often independent)

---

## 5. SATB Voice Types and Ranges

### Standard Ranges
| Voice | Range | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| Soprano | C4 - C6 | Usually carries melody, highest voice |
| Alto | F3 - F5 | Inner voice, often harmony 3rd/6th below soprano |
| Tenor | C3 - C5 | Inner voice, often doubles bass or provides harmony |
| Bass | E2 - E4 | Foundation, root movement, harmonic support |

### Extended Classifications
- **Mezzo-soprano**: Between soprano and alto
- **Contralto**: Lowest female voice (F3 - F5)
- **Baritone**: Between tenor and bass (A2 - A4)
- **Countertenor**: Male voice in alto range

### Tessitura vs. Range
- **Range**: All notes a voice can produce
- **Tessitura**: The comfortable, sustainable range (where the voice sounds best)

---

## 6. Harmonizing Melodies

### Basic Process
1. **Identify the key** (major or minor)
2. **Analyze the melody**: Which notes are chord tones vs. non-chord tones?
3. **Determine harmonic rhythm**: How often do chords change?
4. **Choose chords** that contain the melody notes (or treat melody as extension)
5. **Add harmony voices** following voice leading principles

### Chord Tone Analysis
Each melody note can be:
- **Root** of a chord
- **3rd** of a chord
- **5th** of a chord
- **7th** of a chord (in seventh chords)
- **Extension** (9th, 11th, 13th)
- **Non-chord tone** (passing tone, neighbor, etc.)

### Diatonic Chord Options

**Major Key Triads** (I-ii-iii-IV-V-vi-vii°):
| Degree | Chord | Quality |
|--------|-------|---------|
| I | C | Major |
| ii | Dm | Minor |
| iii | Em | Minor |
| IV | F | Major |
| V | G | Major |
| vi | Am | Minor |
| vii° | Bdim | Diminished |

**Minor Key Triads** (Natural minor: i-ii°-III-iv-v-VI-VII):
| Degree | Chord | Quality |
|--------|-------|---------|
| i | Am | Minor |
| ii° | Bdim | Diminished |
| III | C | Major |
| iv | Dm | Minor |
| v | Em | Minor |
| VI | F | Major |
| VII | G | Major |

**Harmonic Minor** raises the 7th, creating V (major) and vii° (diminished).

### Quick Harmonization Method
For any melody note, consider these chord options:
- Chord where it's the **root**
- Chord where it's the **3rd**
- Chord where it's the **5th**

Example: Melody note E in C major can be harmonized with:
- C major (E is the 3rd)
- E minor (E is the root)
- A minor (E is the 5th)

---

## 7. Non-Chord Tones (Embellishing Tones)

Non-chord tones add melodic interest and are categorized by approach and departure:

### Passing Tone (PT)
- Approached by step
- Left by step in same direction
- Fills in a gap between chord tones
- Can be accented or unaccented

### Neighbor Tone (NT)
- Approached by step
- Returns by step to original note
- Upper neighbor (UN) or lower neighbor (LN)

### Suspension (SUS)
Three parts: Preparation → Suspension → Resolution
- **Preparation**: Consonant, on weak beat
- **Suspension**: Same note, now dissonant, on strong beat
- **Resolution**: Steps down to chord tone

Common suspensions: 4-3, 7-6, 9-8

### Retardation
Like a suspension, but resolves UP instead of down.

### Anticipation (ANT)
- Arrives early to the next chord tone
- Approached by step
- Left by common tone

### Appoggiatura
- Approached by leap
- Left by step (usually in opposite direction)
- Accented (on the beat)

### Escape Tone (ET)
- Approached by step
- Left by leap in opposite direction

### Pedal/Pedal Point
- Sustained note (usually in bass)
- Harmonies change around it
- Typically on tonic or dominant

---

## 8. Two-Part Harmony (Comprehensive Guide)

Two-part harmony is the foundation of vocal harmony—a single melody supported by one harmony voice. This is the most common form in popular music and the building block for more complex arrangements.

---

### 8.1 Core Concept

In two-part harmony:
- **Voice 1 (Lead)**: Sings the melody
- **Voice 2 (Harmony)**: Sings a complementary line, typically a 3rd or 6th above or below

The harmony voice creates a two-note chord with the melody at every moment, and these momentary intervals should:
1. Sound consonant (or resolve properly if dissonant)
2. Fit the underlying chord progression
3. Form a singable, melodic line

---

### 8.2 The Four Usable Intervals

For two-part harmony, you have four primary interval choices:

| Interval | Direction | Character | Best For |
|----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Major 3rd** | Above | Bright, happy | Major key, uplifting moments |
| **Minor 3rd** | Above | Softer, warmer | Minor key, introspective |
| **Major 6th** | Below | Full, warm | Alternative to 3rd above |
| **Minor 6th** | Below | Bittersweet | Minor key passages |

**Why 3rds and 6ths?**
- They are inversions of each other (3rd above = 6th below when voices flip)
- Consonant but not hollow (unlike 5ths/octaves)
- Allow independent voice perception
- Form the foundation of triadic harmony

**Secondary intervals** (use sparingly):
| Interval | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| Perfect 4th | When 3rd clashes; modal music |
| Perfect 5th | Open, powerful moments; phrase endings |
| Unison | Emphasis, phrase starts, word painting |
| Octave | Power, reinforcement |

**Avoid**:
- 2nds and 7ths (too dissonant for sustained use)
- Tritone (unstable, needs resolution)

---

### 8.3 Harmony Above vs. Below the Melody

#### Harmony ABOVE the Melody (3rd above)
- **Sound**: Brighter, more prominent
- **Difficulty**: Easier for beginners
- **Common in**: Pop, rock, folk, country
- **Interval**: Usually major or minor 3rd above

**How it works**: Start on a note 3 scale degrees above the melody and follow the contour.

Example in C major (melody → harmony):
```
Melody:  C  D  E  F  G
Harmony: E  F  G  A  B  (3rd above, diatonic)
```

#### Harmony BELOW the Melody (3rd below / 6th above inverted)
- **Sound**: Warmer, fuller, more grounded
- **Difficulty**: Harder (less intuitive)
- **Common in**: Country, bluegrass, gospel, R&B
- **Interval**: Major or minor 3rd below (equivalent to 6th above)

Example in C major:
```
Melody:  E  F  G  A  B
Harmony: C  D  E  F  G  (3rd below)
```

#### When to Choose Each

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Melody is low in range | Harmony above |
| Melody is high in range | Harmony below |
| Want brightness/energy | Harmony above |
| Want warmth/depth | Harmony below |
| Harmony singer has higher voice | Harmony above |
| Harmony singer has lower voice | Harmony below |
| Beginner harmony singer | Start with above |

---

### 8.4 Diatonic vs. Chromatic Harmony

#### Diatonic Harmony (Stay in Key)
The harmony note is always from the song's key signature.

**Result**: The interval quality changes as you move through the scale:
```
C Major Scale Harmonized in 3rds Above:
Melody:  C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C
Harmony: E   F   G   A   B   C   D   E
Interval: M3  m3  m3  M3  M3  m3  m3  M3
         (M3=Major 3rd, m3=minor 3rd)
```

**Advantages**:
- Always fits the key
- Natural, familiar sound
- Chord-friendly

**Challenges**:
- Interval quality shifts (M3 ↔ m3)
- Some positions may clash with specific chords

#### Chromatic Harmony (Fixed Interval)
Keep the exact same interval quality throughout (e.g., always major 3rd = 4 semitones).

**Result**: The harmony may include notes outside the key:
```
Melody:  C   D   E   F   G   (in C major)
Harmony: E   F#  G#  A   B   (always M3 above)
         ↑   ↑   ↑
         in key  chromatic
```

**Advantages**:
- Consistent color/character
- Can create interesting tension

**Challenges**:
- May clash with underlying chords
- Sounds "outside" or jazzy
- Harder to sing accurately

**Recommendation**: Use diatonic harmony for most applications. Chromatic parallel harmony is a special effect.

---

### 8.5 The Chord-Tone Priority System

When the melody note is a chord tone, the harmony should also be a chord tone.

#### Priority Order for Selecting Harmony Notes

1. **First choice**: Another chord tone (root, 3rd, or 5th)
2. **Second choice**: A chord extension (7th, 9th) if stylistically appropriate
3. **Last resort**: A non-chord tone that resolves properly

#### Example: Melody on E over C major chord (C-E-G)

| Harmony Option | Note | Interval from E | Quality |
|----------------|------|-----------------|---------|
| Best | G | Minor 3rd above | Chord tone (5th) |
| Good | C | Major 3rd below | Chord tone (root) |
| Acceptable | A | Perfect 4th above | Non-chord (resolve to G) |
| Avoid | F | Minor 2nd above | Dissonant clash |

#### The "Chord Tone Rule"

```
If melody = chord tone → harmony = chord tone
If melody = non-chord tone → harmony can be:
   a) Parallel non-chord tone (same type, e.g., both passing)
   b) Chord tone (if it sounds good)
   c) Contrary motion to a chord tone
```

---

### 8.6 Handling Non-Chord Tones in the Melody

When the melody has passing tones, neighbor tones, or other embellishments:

#### Option 1: Parallel Embellishment
The harmony mirrors the melody's embellishment:
```
Chord: C major
Melody:  E - F - G  (E and G are chord tones, F is passing)
Harmony: C - D - E  (C and E are chord tones, D is passing)
```

#### Option 2: Hold the Chord Tone
The harmony stays on a chord tone while melody embellishes:
```
Chord: C major
Melody:  E - F - G
Harmony: C - C - E  (C holds through the passing tone)
```

#### Option 3: Contrary Motion
The harmony moves opposite to the melody:
```
Chord: C major
Melody:  E - F - G  (ascending)
Harmony: C - C - C  (or C - B - C, contrary embellishment)
```

---

### 8.7 Voice Leading for the Harmony Part

The harmony line should be singable and melodic on its own.

#### Guidelines for Smooth Harmony Lines

1. **Prefer stepwise motion** (moving by 2nds)
   - Good: C → D → E → F
   - Avoid: C → F → A → D (too jumpy)

2. **Limit leaps to consonant intervals**
   - Allowed: 3rds, 4ths, 5ths, octaves
   - Avoid: 7ths, tritones, augmented intervals

3. **Follow leaps with stepwise motion** (often in opposite direction)
   - Good: C → G → F → E (leap up, step down)
   - Awkward: C → G → D → A (leap after leap)

4. **Mirror the melody's contour** (most of the time)
   - When melody goes up, harmony usually goes up
   - Exception: Contrary motion at cadences or for variety

#### Maximum Recommended Leaps
| Interval | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| 2nd (step) | Ideal - use freely |
| 3rd | Common - use freely |
| 4th | Occasional - approach/leave by step |
| 5th | Rare - only at phrase boundaries |
| 6th+ | Very rare - special effect only |

---

### 8.8 Problem Spots and Solutions

#### Problem 1: The 3rd Clashes with the Chord

**Situation**: Melody is on the 4th scale degree; 3rd above is the 6th scale degree, but the chord doesn't contain the 6th.

**Solutions**:
- Use a 4th above instead (staying on chord tone)
- Use a 6th below (different inversion)
- Use contrary motion (hold previous note)

#### Problem 2: Parallel 5ths or Octaves

**Situation**: Two consecutive intervals are both perfect 5ths (or octaves).

**Why it's a problem**: Sounds hollow, loses voice independence.

**Solutions**:
- Change one of the intervals to a 3rd or 6th
- Use contrary motion
- Use oblique motion (hold one note)

```
Bad:  C→D (5th: G→A)  // Parallel 5ths
Good: C→D (5th: G→F#) // 5th to 3rd
Good: C→D (5th: G→G)  // Oblique motion
```

#### Problem 3: Awkward Leap in Harmony

**Situation**: Following the melody in 3rds creates a large leap.

**Solutions**:
- Switch from 3rd above to 6th below (or vice versa)
- Insert a passing tone in the harmony
- Use oblique motion through the difficult spot

#### Problem 4: The "Avoid Note" (Minor 9th Clash)

**Situation**: Harmony note is a minor 2nd (or minor 9th) from a chord tone.

**Example**: Over C major, harmony on F clashes with E in the chord.

**Why**: The minor 9th interval (F against E) is very dissonant.

**Solutions**:
- Move the harmony to a different chord tone
- Treat F as a quick passing tone (don't sustain it)
- Change the underlying chord

#### Problem 5: The Harmony Crosses the Melody

**Situation**: The "above" harmony dips below the melody (or vice versa).

**Solutions**:
- Stay in your lane (above or below)
- If crossing is needed, switch permanently to the other side
- Use unison at the crossing point

---

### 8.9 The Sliding Harmony Technique

A practical method for real-time harmony singing:

1. **Find your starting note** (3rd or 6th from the melody)
2. **Hold it** as long as it sounds good with the chord
3. **When it clashes**, slide up or down a half or whole step
4. **You're never more than a step away** from a note that works

This works because:
- Chords share common tones
- Neighboring notes often fit as extensions
- Small movements are easy to execute

---

### 8.10 Algorithm for Two-Part Harmony Generation

For computational harmony generation, follow this decision tree:

```
INPUT: melody_note, current_chord, previous_harmony_note, key

1. DETERMINE if melody_note is a CHORD TONE:
   - If YES: harmony candidates = other chord tones
   - If NO: harmony candidates = chord tones ± parallel NCT

2. CALCULATE intervals from melody to each candidate:
   - Filter to: 3rds, 4ths, 5ths, 6ths (prefer 3rds/6ths)

3. APPLY voice leading filter:
   - Calculate distance from previous_harmony_note
   - Prefer stepwise motion (distance ≤ 2 semitones)
   - Allow leaps ≤ 5 semitones if approaching/leaving by step

4. CHECK for parallel 5ths/octaves:
   - If previous interval was P5/P8, current must NOT be P5/P8
   - If violation, remove that candidate

5. SCORE remaining candidates:
   - +3 points: chord tone (root, 3rd, 5th)
   - +2 points: stepwise from previous
   - +1 point: 3rd or 6th interval
   - -1 point: leap > 3 semitones
   - -2 points: 4th or 5th interval
   - -3 points: forms dissonance with chord

6. SELECT highest-scoring candidate

OUTPUT: harmony_note
```

#### Simplified Version (80% of cases):

```
1. Get the current chord tones
2. Find chord tones that are a 3rd above or below melody
3. Pick the one closest to the previous harmony note
4. If none exist, try 4th or 6th
5. If still none, use the chord's 5th
```

### 8.11 Interval Table: Harmony from Any Melody Note

Quick reference for harmonizing each scale degree in a major key:

| Melody (Scale Degree) | 3rd Above | 3rd Below | 6th Above | Notes |
|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| 1 (Do) | 3 (Mi) | 6 (La) | 6 (La) | All chord tones of I |
| 2 (Re) | 4 (Fa) | 7 (Ti) | 7 (Ti) | 4 may clash; try 6th |
| 3 (Mi) | 5 (Sol) | 1 (Do) | 1 (Do) | All chord tones of I |
| 4 (Fa) | 6 (La) | 2 (Re) | 2 (Re) | Good for IV chord |
| 5 (Sol) | 7 (Ti) | 3 (Mi) | 3 (Mi) | All chord tones of I or V |
| 6 (La) | 1 (Do) | 4 (Fa) | 4 (Fa) | 4 may need resolution |
| 7 (Ti) | 2 (Re) | 5 (Sol) | 5 (Sol) | Both work; 7 wants to resolve |

---

### 8.12 Special Techniques

#### Unison Moments
Start or end phrases in unison for:
- Emphasis
- Clarity of lyrics
- Setting up the harmony entry

#### Octave Doubling
Use octaves (instead of 3rds/6ths) for:
- Power and impact
- Climactic moments
- When 3rds/6ths clash

#### Contrary Motion at Cadences
End phrases with contrary motion:
```
Melody:  ...G → C (down)
Harmony: ...E → E or ...D → E (up or hold)
```

#### The "Lock" Technique
Both voices sing the same rhythm, same syllables—locked together. This creates the tightest blend.

#### Echo/Response
Harmony answers the melody rather than singing simultaneously:
```
Melody:  "Hello..."  [rest]
Harmony: [rest]      "Hello..."
```

---

### 8.13 Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Always using exact 3rds | Creates monotony; some clash | Vary between 3rds, 4ths, 6ths |
| Ignoring the chord | Harmony clashes | Always check chord tones |
| Big leaps in harmony | Hard to sing, sounds disjointed | Keep motion stepwise |
| Parallel 5ths/octaves | Hollow, unprofessional | Use contrary/oblique motion |
| Crossing voices | Confusing, muddy | Stay in your lane |
| Harmony louder than melody | Distracting | Melody should dominate |
| Harmonizing every note | Exhausting, cluttered | Rest, use unison, selective harmony |

---

### 8.14 Exercises for Learning Two-Part Harmony

1. **Sing scales in 3rds**: One person sings C-D-E-F-G, other sings E-F-G-A-B
2. **Simple songs**: Harmonize "Happy Birthday," "Amazing Grace"
3. **Chord-tone drill**: Arpeggiate a chord while partner holds one note
4. **Call and response**: Leader sings phrase, follower echoes a 3rd higher
5. **Switch positions**: Practice both above and below the melody

---

### 8.15 Two-Part Harmony by Genre

| Genre | Typical Approach | Signature Sound |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Pop** | 3rd above, tight rhythmic lock | Clean, polished, doubles |
| **Folk** | 3rd above or below, natural blend | Organic, acoustic |
| **Country** | 3rd below common, "brother duet" | Tight 3rds, plaintive |
| **R&B/Soul** | 3rd and 6th, more embellishment | Melismatic, emotional |
| **Rock** | Power 5ths, octaves, occasional 3rds | Aggressive, full |
| **Gospel** | Block movement, 3rds and 6ths | Powerful, parallel motion |
| **Jazz** | 3rds, 6ths, extensions (9ths) | Sophisticated, chromatic |

---

## 9. Three-Part Harmony

### Structure
Three voices create complete triads (root, 3rd, 5th):
- **High harmony**: Above the melody
- **Melody**: Usually in the middle (can be on top)
- **Low harmony**: Below the melody

### The "Lanes" Concept
Each part should "stay in its lane":
- High harmony consistently above
- Low harmony consistently below
- Avoid excessive crossing

### Creating Three-Part Harmonies

**Method 1: Stack thirds**
- Melody note
- Add 3rd above (major or minor depending on key)
- Add 3rd below (or 6th above the melody)

**Method 2: Chord-tone approach**
- For each melody note, determine the chord
- Assign other chord tones to the two harmony voices
- Adjust inversions as needed for smooth voice leading

### Balance Considerations
- The melody should be loudest/most prominent
- High harmonies can overshadow—reduce if needed
- Keep all three voices within an octave (close position) for tight blend

---

## 10. Four-Part (SATB) Harmony

### Standard Arrangement
- **Soprano**: Melody (highest)
- **Alto**: Harmony (inner voice)
- **Tenor**: Harmony (inner voice)
- **Bass**: Foundation (lowest, often root)

### Voicing Types

**Close Position**: All upper voices within an octave
- Tight, blended sound
- Common in barbershop, doo-wop

**Open Position**: Upper voices spread beyond an octave
- More orchestral, spacious
- Common in choral music, hymns

### Four-Part Voice Leading Summary
1. Identify the chord and its function
2. Place the bass note (usually root or inversion bass)
3. Assign soprano (melody)
4. Fill in alto and tenor with remaining chord tones
5. Double the root when one note must be repeated
6. Check for parallel 5ths/octaves between all voice pairs
7. Ensure smooth motion in all voices

---

## 11. Close Harmony Styles

### Barbershop Harmony

**Characteristics**:
- Four-part a cappella
- Close voicing (upper three voices within an octave)
- Heavy use of dominant 7th chords (35-60% of chords)
- Voice arrangement: Lead (melody), Tenor (above), Baritone (below), Bass
- Just intonation for "ringing" overtones

**The Barbershop 7th**:
- Uses the harmonic 7th (7:4 ratio)
- ~31 cents flatter than equal temperament
- Creates distinctive "ringing" when tuned correctly
- Frequency ratios: 4:5:6:7

**Voice Arrangement** (different from SATB):
| Voice | Position | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| Tenor | Highest | Harmony above lead |
| Lead | Second highest | Melody |
| Baritone | Second lowest | Fills in harmony |
| Bass | Lowest | Foundation |

### Doo-Wop / R&B Harmony
- Often 4-5 voices
- Bass voice patterns (nonsense syllables)
- Close triadic harmony
- Call and response elements

---

## 12. Gospel and Soul Harmony

### Characteristics
- Block chord movement (voices move together)
- Heavy use of parallel motion (contrary motion for effect)
- Emphasis on emotional delivery and dynamics
- Call and response patterns
- Extended chords (7ths, 9ths, 11ths)

### Gospel Arranging Approach
1. Harmonize melody with block triads
2. All voices match the rhythm and phrasing of the lead
3. Double soprano in bass for power
4. Use unison/octaves for emphasis
5. Dynamic swells and diminuendos

### The "Choir" Sound
- Close harmony in upper voices
- Powerful unison/octave bass
- Intense vibrato and emotional delivery
- Rhythmic precision across all parts

---

## 13. Pop/Rock Vocal Harmony

### Modern Pop Characteristics
- Simpler arrangements (2-3 part harmony)
- Harmonies enter after melody established
- Thirds above are most common
- Tight rhythmic alignment with lead
- Heavy production (doubling, auto-tune, effects)

### Production Techniques
1. **Double-tracking**: Record each part 2-4 times, pan L/R
2. **Tight editing**: Align timing precisely to lead
3. **Pitch correction**: Ensure perfect tuning
4. **Stacking**: Multiple takes of same part for thickness

### Arrangement Tips
- Don't harmonize everything—save for impactful moments
- Choruses typically have more harmony than verses
- Use single lines on verses, fuller on choruses
- Counter-melodies can be more interesting than parallel harmony

## 14. Country/Bluegrass Harmony

### The "High Lonesome" Sound
- Tight three-part harmony
- Lead in middle, tenor above, baritone below
- Modal influences (Dorian, Mixolydian)
- Emotionally intense, plaintive quality

### Bluegrass Stack
- **Tenor**: High harmony, often a 3rd above lead
- **Lead**: Melody (middle voice)
- **Baritone**: Low harmony, often a 3rd or 5th below

### Characteristic Features
- Close harmony voicing
- Frequent unisons on phrase starts
- Brother duet style (tight 3rds)
- Emphasis on blend over individual tone

---

## 15. Modal Harmony

### The Seven Modes
| Mode | Character | Characteristic Note |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| Ionian | Major | Natural 7th |
| Dorian | Minor with hope | Raised 6th |
| Phrygian | Dark, Spanish | Flat 2nd |
| Lydian | Bright, floating | Raised 4th |
| Mixolydian | Major with blues | Flat 7th |
| Aeolian | Natural minor | Flat 6th and 7th |
| Locrian | Diminished, unstable | Flat 2nd and 5th |

### Common Modes in Popular Music
- **Dorian**: Jazz, funk, R&B ("Billie Jean," "Evil Ways")
- **Mixolydian**: Rock, folk, country (Rolling Stones, Irish music)
- **Aeolian**: Pop, rock (most "minor key" songs)

### Modal Harmony Tips
1. Avoid dominant → tonic progressions (too functional)
2. Use pedal tones to establish modal center
3. Emphasize characteristic notes/chords
4. Voicings in 4ths work well for modal sounds

## 16. Jazz Vocal Harmony

### Extended Chords
Jazz harmony extends beyond triads and 7ths:

| Extension | Interval from Root | Common Usage |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| 9th | Major 2nd + octave | Add color to all chord types |
| 11th | Perfect 4th + octave | Minor chords (avoid on major) |
| #11 | Augmented 4th + octave | Major and dominant chords |
| 13th | Major 6th + octave | Dominant chords especially |

### Voicing Principles
1. **Omit the 5th**: It adds little color
2. **Root optional**: Bass handles it
3. **3rd and 7th essential**: Define chord quality
4. **Extensions on top**: Keep them in upper register

### Voice Leading in Jazz
- 3rd of one chord → 7th of next
- 7th of one chord → 3rd of next
- 9th → 13th movements
- Chromatic approach tones

### Tritone Substitution
Replace V7 with bII7 (shares the same tritone):
- G7 → Db7 (both have B and F)
- Creates chromatic bass motion: ii - bII7 - I (D - Db - C)

### Secondary Dominants
V7/x = dominant 7th chord leading to any diatonic chord:
- V7/ii, V7/iii, V7/IV, V7/V, V7/vi
- Creates forward motion through the cycle of fifths

---

## 17. Arranging Techniques

### Melody Distribution
- Pass melody between voices for variety
- Don't give one voice all the work
- Let different voices "shine" at different moments

### Texture Variation
| Texture | Description | Effect |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Unison | All voices same note | Power, emphasis |
| Octaves | Voices an octave apart | Fuller unison |
| Two-part | Melody + one harmony | Simple, clear |
| Three-part | Full triads | Rich, complete |
| Four-part | SATB | Full, complex |

### Countermelody/Descant
- Secondary melody that complements the main melody
- Often simpler rhythm, longer notes
- Usually above the melody
- Can be very memorable (hooks)

### Dynamic Arrangement
- Build from sparse to full as song progresses
- Verses: fewer parts
- Choruses: fuller harmony
- Bridge: change texture dramatically
- Final chorus: biggest arrangement

### Call and Response
- Leader sings phrase
- Group responds (echo, completion, commentary)
- Rooted in African-American musical traditions
- Creates energy and engagement

## 18. Practical Harmonization Checklist

### Before You Start
- [ ] Know the key
- [ ] Know the chord progression
- [ ] Identify melody range and tessitura
- [ ] Determine how many voices you want

### For Each Phrase
- [ ] Identify chord tones in melody
- [ ] Identify non-chord tones and their type
- [ ] Choose harmony notes from the chord
- [ ] Check for parallel 5ths/octaves
- [ ] Ensure smooth voice leading
- [ ] Verify all parts are singable

### Final Check
- [ ] Does the melody remain prominent?
- [ ] Do all parts have interesting lines?
- [ ] Is the texture appropriate for the style?
- [ ] Are there any voice crossing issues?
- [ ] Does it sound good?

## 19. Common Harmony Formulas

### By Interval Above Melody
| Situation | Try This |
|-----------|----------|
| Default choice | Major/minor 3rd above |
| 3rd clashes with chord | 6th above (or 3rd below) |
| Want openness | 4th or 5th above |
| Building tension | 2nd or 7th |
| Emphasis/power | Unison or octave |

### By Genre
| Genre | Typical Approach |
|-------|------------------|
| Pop | 3rds above, simple 2-3 parts |
| Rock | Power 5ths, octaves, 3rds |
| R&B/Soul | Stacked 3rds, 7ths, close harmony |
| Country | Brother duet 3rds, bluegrass stack |
| Gospel | Block chords, parallel motion |
| Jazz | Extensions, altered tones, 4ths |
| Barbershop | Close 4-part, dominant 7ths |
| Classical | SATB, strict voice leading |

## Summary

Vocal harmony is built on:
1. **Intervals** - the distance between notes
2. **Consonance/dissonance** - tension and release
3. **Voice leading** - smooth connection between chords
4. **Chord tones** - fitting harmony to the underlying progression
5. **Style awareness** - adapting techniques to genre

The most universally useful harmonies use **3rds and 6ths** because they:
- Blend well with melody
- Are consonant but interesting
- Work in virtually all styles
- Are easy to sing

Start simple (one harmony voice in 3rds), then expand as needed. Always prioritize **singability** and **musical effect** over theoretical perfection.
